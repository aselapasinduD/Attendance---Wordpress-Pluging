## Description

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections). For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

## Installation

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
e.g:
 1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/attendance`
    directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins
    screen directly.
 2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

## Arbitrary Section

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or "installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
